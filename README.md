# Trie Me

A couple of demos using the trie data structure.

## Autocomplete

The `autocomplete` folder shows a basic example of autocompletion for an input field by taking a dictionary of words, constructing a trie with them, then finding all words that start with the value from the input.

## Censor

The `censor` folder contains another basic example of how to add words to a trie, then censor any words in the `sentence` input if they found in the trie.
